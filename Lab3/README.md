# CPE 322 Lab 3
## Python

### Introduction
This lab aims to demonstrate the capabilities of python and some of its packages using sample scripts from the IOT repository.

**Dependencies:** 

The first step in running these scripts is to make sure the proper python packages are installed. This can be done through pip, the package manager for python.
```
pip install jdcal
pip install astral
pip install geopy
pip install pytz
pip install psutil
```

**Script 1:** `Julian.py`
This script prints out the calendar date, as well as the Julian and modified Julian date.

**Script 6:** `moon.py`
This script provides the phases of the moon for the next full cycle represented as integers, with 27 -> 0 being the new moon.

**Script 7:** `coordinates.py`
This script provides the address, as well as the latitude and longitude for the building provided. In this example the Stevens Library was used.

**Script 8:** `address.py`
This command takes provided latitude and longitude and converts that into the address of whatever building is located at those coordinates. Once again, the example used is the Stevens library.

**Script 9:** `cpu.py`
Prints the numbers of physical and logical CPU cores on the machine, as well as each one's utilization.

**Script 10:** `battery.py`
This displays various information related to the machine's power supply, such as the current battery percentage and whether it is unplugged.

**Script 11:** `documentstats.py`
This script displays the word count of a document, as well as it's most common words and their frequencies.
